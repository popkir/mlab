hello!

This week, we have a competition! You should be using all of the models we've gone over to make predictions on a dataset. In particular, this dataset is predicting whether someone will default on their credit card this month (its a binary classification task).

The competition is hosted on kaggle.com at https://www.kaggle.com/t/52245ebe25174263897e2e3b3f3b9b66 .

Write your code in your repo and evaluate it on kaggle (try their tutorial if you haven't used it before to get the hang of it). 
Learn to use the scikit-learn library, and use the models:
    Logistic Regression 
    Logistic Regression with L1 and L2 regularization
    Decision Trees
    Random Forests
    Optional: try SVM's. We'll go over them next week.

to get your predictions. Eternal glory awaits whichever partner pair has the best ROC-AUC score by the end of the week. You must submit at least 5 submissions, which means you ought to start working earlier. Much of the work in this homework is working with data, addressing overfitting, and the such. 

We also have a few conceptual questions in questions.txt that should be answered.
